PyFGCZ
======

*BioBeamer* helps to collect huge amounts of instrument data (M|G|TBytes).
An example configuration collecting mass spectrometric measurement of more 
than a dozen devices can be seen through
http://fgcz-data.uzh.ch/config/BioBeamer.xml.

*FCC* is a minimalistic workflow engine.
The specification/properties of the program are as follow:

- converting instrument files, e.g., RAW-files to all kinds of formats

- being generic

- follows FGCZ hierarch storage granularity: project, user, instrument, time range

- multi- platform, host, task

- configurable through xml file which means new converter by new tag in xml file NO CODE CHANGE!

- stdout and errout through syslog 

A current configugration can be found through http://fgcz-data.uzh.ch/config/fcc_config.xml.
